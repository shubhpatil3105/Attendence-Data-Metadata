Carbon Offset Tokenization

This project implements Carbon Offset Tokenization by interacting with an Ethereum smart contract to enable users to log, retrieve, and track carbon emissions. The system comprises:

A Solidity Smart Contract deployed on Ethereum-compatible blockchains.

A simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend that uses Web3.js to interact with the smart contract.

Features

Log Emissions: Users can input emission amounts (in kilograms) along with a brief description of the source.

View Total Emissions: Retrieve the cumulative carbon emissions logged by the user.

Fetch Emission Logs: Retrieve and display all recorded emission entries, including timestamps.

Prerequisites

MetaMask: A browser wallet to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.

Node.js (optional, for local hosting of the frontend).

A deployed version of the Solidity contract on a testnet or mainnet.

Project Setup

Smart Contract Deployment

Open Remix IDE.

Deploy the CarbonFootprintTracker contract provided in the Solidity code.

Copy the contract address after deployment.

Replace <YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> in the contractAddress variable in the frontend JavaScript file.

Update the ABI in the contractABI variable to match the deployed contract.

Frontend Setup

Download the project files (e.g., index.html, style.css, script.js).

Open the index.html file in a browser.

Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to the same network as the deployed contract.

How to Use

Log Emissions:

Enter the emission amount (in kilograms) and a brief description in the provided input fields.

Click the "Log Emission" button to record the data on the blockchain.

View Total Emissions:

Click the "Get Total Emissions" button to view your cumulative emissions recorded in the contract.

Fetch Emission Logs:

Click the "Get Emission Entries" button to retrieve and display all recorded emission logs.

Project Files

index.html: The main frontend file.

style.css: Styling for the frontend.

script.js: JavaScript file handling Web3.js interactions.

Solidity Smart Contract: Source code for deployment.

Technologies Used

Solidity: For smart contract development.

Web3.js: To interact with the blockchain from the frontend.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: For the frontend user interface.

MetaMask: Browser wallet for blockchain transactions.

Example Workflow

Deploy the contract using Remix IDE and copy the contract address.

Update the contractAddress and contractABI variables in script.js.

Open the index.html file in a browser and connect MetaMask.

Log an emission (e.g., "100 kg from car travel").

Fetch the total emissions and verify the recorded entries.

Notes

Ensure MetaMask is connected to the correct blockchain network.

Gas fees will apply for contract interactions on testnet or mainnet.

Future Improvements

Add authentication for users to ensure data privacy.

Allow exporting emission logs for external analysis.

Integrate real-world APIs to calculate emissions dynamically.
